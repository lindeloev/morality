Experiment on the influence of free Working Memory Capacity (WMC) on social
cognition. WMC is loaded using a Complex Span (CS) task and social cognition is
measured using the Public Goods Game (PGG).

This experiments support various variations: span lengths, stimulus type etc.

This script uses the psychopy python module, a powerful framework for stimulus
delivery. Read more and download it at www.psychopy.org.

Thanks for choosing to participate in the study about memory and interaction. Please read the instructions carefully and follow them. You have a copy of these instructions on a sheet of paper next to you.

In this study you will be asked to memorize letters or faces, complete some simple arithmetic tests, and participate in an interaction task. Consider that your final payment will be determined by your performance as a mean of your results on the Memory and Arithmetic tasks and a randomly chosen round of the Interaction task. So, be sure to perform the best that you can each time!

The experiment is completely anonymous. The results of this research may be published, but no individual data will be published.

At some point towards the end of the experiment the red screen will show again. Just wait for the experimenter to pick you up for a glucose measurement when that happens.

instructPGG1 = """*** Interaction task example ***
You invest 30 DKK and the other participant invests 70 DKK.
So you and the other participant put a total of 100 DKK in the common pool. It is multiplied by 1.5 and becomes 150 DKK.
You keep the remaining 70 DKK (100 - 30 = 70) and get half of the pool. So in total you get 70 + 150/2 = 145 DKK.

In this case, had you invested 0 DKK (nothing), you'd get 135 DKK (and he/she would get 65 DKK).
If you invested 100 DKK you'd earn 127.5 DKK (and he/she would get 167.5 DKK).

Let's do a few examples so you get a feeling for this. Type in the correct answer to the following four questions.

You will be shown a face, an equation, a face, an equation etc. 

Arithmetic: You should complete an arithmetic task as quickly as possible. If you do not answer within 5 seconds, it will count as wrong answer and the task continues. You should use the keys ARROW UP (=correct) or ARROW DOWN (=incorrect) to answer whether the equations are correct or not. E.g. when shown "2*2+4=8 ?" press ARROW UP because it is correct. When shown "6/3-2=2 ?" press ARROW DOWN because it is incorrect.

Faces: In the end, you will have to recall which faces were presented. Use the arrow keys to navigate between 12 options and SPACE to select the faces you saw. Press RETURN when you have finished. You will get points if you select the correct face at the correct location in the sequence. If you forget e.g. what was the first face presented, just choose your best guess.
