Experiment on the influence of free Working Memory Capacity (WMC) on social
cognition. WMC is loaded using a Complex Span (CS) task and social cognition is
measured using the Public Goods Game (PGG).

This experiments support various variations: span lengths, stimulus type etc.

This script uses the psychopy python module, a powerful framework for stimulus
delivery. Read more and download it at www.psychopy.org.

instructWelcome = u"""*** Welcome! ***

Thanks for choosing to participate in the study about memory and dot counting. Please read the instructions carefully and follow them. You have a copy of these instructions on a sheet of paper next to you.

In this study you will be asked to memorize letters or faces, complete some simple arithmetic tests, and count dots. You will earn extra money depending on how you respond on the dots task but in order to keep most of these money, you will have to do well on memory and equations. This simply means that you will earn the most from doing your best on all parts of this experiment!

The experiment is completely anonymous. The results of this research may be published, but no individual data will be published.

Press RETURN to continue..."""


instructDots = u"""*** Dots task ***

You will be shown some dots to the left and some dots to the right. Use the left- and right-arrow keys to indicate which side has the most dots. The dots will be shown a limited amount of time, so be quick.

Choosing one side will earn you ten times more money than the other. But note that your task is solely to respond which side has the most dots, even when that side gives you a smaller bonus than the other. Depending on your answers, you can earn between %i kr. (always choosing the low-payout side) and %i kr. (always choosing the high-payout side), assuming that you have perfect performance on the memory and arithmetic. Again, this doesn't really matter since you should only attend to the number of dots.

Press Return to continue..."""

instructDotsControlCheat = u"""*** Dots task ***

Now you will do just the dots task without the memory and arithmetic. As during the first part of the experiment, the payouts are shown on each side but your task is to respond which side has the most dots.

Press RETURN to continue..."""

instructDotsControlAccuracy = u"""*** Dots task ***

Now you will do just the dots task without the memory and arithmetic. Here you will always get the highest payout by choosing the side with the most dots. Note that during this part of the experiment, payouts are not shown since that would reveal the correct answer.

Press RETURN to continue..."""

instructEquations = u"""*** Equations ***

In the upcoming experiment, you will have to check equations like 9/3 + 2 = 5 and see whether it is true, i.e. whether the left hand side and the right hand side are the same number.

Just to brush up your basic math, multiply and divide BEFORE adding or subtracting. So in the equation "6/2 - 3 = 1", first divide so it simplifies to "3 - 3 = 1" and then do the subtraction so it simplifies to "0 = 1". You will see that this equation is wrong.

As another example, '2*4 - 3 = 5' simplifies to '8 - 3 = 5' which simplifies to '5 = 5' and you see now that this equation is correct.
"""

instructCSFaces = u"""*** Instructions for memory and arithmetic ***

You will be shown a face, an equation, a face, an equation etc. 

Equations: Use the keys ARROW UP (=correct) or ARROW DOWN (=incorrect) to answer whether the equations are correct or not. E.g. when shown "2*2+4=8 ?" press ARROW UP because it is correct. When shown "6/3-2=2 ?" press ARROW DOWN because it is incorrect. 

It is very important that you do the arithmetic task as quickly and accurately as possible. You will be given feedback on how accuracte you've been so far in the experiment. It is VERY important that you answer at least 85% of the equations correctly since we would otherwise have to discard your data. Also, if you are too slow, your answer will be discarded and you will not earn money from that trial. What counts as slow will be determined from your other responses, so we cannot give you any specific time here. Doing your best to respond quickly should keep you safely below the time limit.

Faces: In the end, you will have to recall which faces were presented. Use the arrow keys to navigate between 12 options and SPACE to select the faces you saw. Press RETURN when you have finished. You will get points if you select the correct face at the correct location in the sequence. If you forget e.g. what was the first face presented, just choose your best guess.

You will now have to do both the dots task and the memory/arithmetic task. You start with faces/arithmetic but just before the recall, you will be presented with the dots task. After recall you will be given feedback on how well you did. Remember that it is VERY important that you answer at least 85% of the equations correctly for us to use your data but also for you to earn the largest bonus. The better you do on average, the more you'll earn! However, on half of the rounds, the money will be recieved by someone who will participate in this experiment later instead of you.

Some trials will be easy. Others will be very hard. Don't worry, just do your best.
